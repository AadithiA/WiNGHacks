              <h2>Dealing with Bipolar Disorder</h2>
              <p>Everyone has different anxiety disorders, and it is important to know what to do when you are experiencing one. Anxiety disorders are unique for each person, and they can be hard to deal with. Here are some tips to help you deal with anxiety.</p>
              <li><b>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT): </b>DBT is a type of psychotherapy specifically designed to help individuals with BPD manage intense emotions, improve relationships, and develop coping skills. It focuses on mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.</li>
              <li><b>Medication Management</b> While medication is not a cure for BPD, certain medications such as mood stabilizers, antidepressants, or antipsychotics may help alleviate specific symptoms such as mood swings, impulsivity, or depression. It's essential to work closely with a psychiatrist to determine the most appropriate medication regimen.</li>
              <li><b>Establish Healthy Boundaries:</b> Learning to set and maintain healthy boundaries in relationships is crucial for individuals with BPD. This may involve assertively communicating needs and limits, recognizing when to say no, and seeking support from loved ones or therapy when navigating challenging interpersonal dynamics. </li>
